## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

data("Titanic")
head(Titanic)
titanic_df <- as.data.frame(Titanic)
# Summary for the 'Sex' variable (categorical)
table(titanic_df$Sex)
# Summary for the 'Age' variable (quantitative)
summary(titanic_df$Age)
class(titanic_df$Age)
titanic_df$Age = as.numeric(as.character(titanic_df$Age))
class(titanic_df$Age)
any(is.na(titanic_df$Age))
# 2. Transform at least one variable.
# In this case, we can calculate the mean of the 'Age' variable.
mean_age <- mean(titanic_df$Age, na.rm = TRUE)
titanic_df$Age[is.na(titanic_df$Age)] <- mean_age
mean_age <- mean(titanic_df$Age)
cat("Mean Age:", mean_age, "\n")
